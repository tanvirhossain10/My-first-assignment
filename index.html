                    Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it's the work that happens behind the
                    scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. ...
                    The
                    field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end
                    (the server side).
